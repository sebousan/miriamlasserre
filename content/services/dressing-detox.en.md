Did you know that most people only wear 20% of their wardrobe?

If that sounds like you, the Dressing Detox is what you need, especially before your next shopping spree. A personal in-home consultation, during which Miriam will:

* **Analyze your wardrobe**: selecting the good basics you should always have, as well as the pieces which best flatter your silhouette, your complexion, your style…
* **Sorting** out clothes that don’t fit you, are too damaged or out-of-style.
* **Optimize your wardrobe** and help you work with what you already have by composing several timeless styles that you can wear all year long
* **Share expert tips** to accessorize your outfits.
* **Identify** what’s lacking in your wardrobe.

After this consultation, your closet will be decluttered, organized, and you will receive a personalized lookbook summing up the outfits that Miriam styled for you and her made-to-measure fashion advice. Miriam will also provide you with options for places to shop to complete your wardrobe.
