Do you wear certain colors because you like them or because they’re trendy ? Have you ever wondered if they were actually highlighting you best features? Carefully selecting the colors you wear is a milestone which can radically improve your image, make you look younger, more radiant and much more confident !



The color analysis reveals which color pallets most brighten your natural assets (*complexion, skin-tone, and body-type).*



After the session you will receive your digital palette (70 Pantone Colors)and a document reviewing all the tips.  You will have all the details about your season and sub-season and how to use your colors to look at your best. You will have as well your best shadows for make up (foundation, blush, lipstick, mascara and eyeshadow) and your best metals and precious stones.



Following the color analysis and Miriam’s personalized tips, you will know exactly which shades to shift towards when you shop for both your make-up and clothes!
