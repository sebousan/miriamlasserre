The Colorimetry test can also be done at distance with a precise method based on the analysis of photos of your face and your iris in determined conditions:

* without make up and glasses
* with natural light
* no direct sunlight exposition
* specific time daylight
* specific frame

The analysis of those photos determines which is your exact palette following the 12 seasons method as well as your exact facial shape.

Miriam will send you an email with a link to a Zoom meeting a day and hour that you will have determined before. You will have all the indications to make the photos and send them (minimum 7 days before the meeting)

The Zoom Meeting with Miriam lasts 1 hour. Miriam will explain you the basis of the Colorimetry method and the different facial shapes. Those explanations will allow you understand the results of the analysis of your individual Colorimetry and facial shape.

Miriam will explain:

* Your season and sub-season with your palette of colors and how to use it and your facial shape and how to create harmony.

1 week after, you will receive your digital color palette and a document (about 20 pages) with precise explanations about:

* Your Colorimetry and how to use it to create enhancing outfits. Your best colors for make up (foundation, lipstick, blush, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and mascara) and some references that match your season.

* Your facial shape and corrections to apply (if needed) to add harmony and balance to your personal image by accessories, glasses, earrings, haircuts and hair colors.
