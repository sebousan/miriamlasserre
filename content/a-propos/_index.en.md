    quote: “ Your clothes say a lot about you. They reflect your personnality, your
      lifestyle, and the choices you make. Selecting your wardrobe with care
      makes a big difference and can faciliate your daily life on many levels!
      My goal is to listen to my clients, help them develop and reveal their
      true style, and assist them in building a wardrobe that will adapt to
      every occasion. ”

      “ These days there are so many fashion collections and trends that people
      get easily overwhelmed, lost, and discouraged. They want to be trendy but
      can’t figure out which styles will flatter their figure, or they
      compulsively buy the “ It ” piece of the season, which gathers dust in
      their closet because it was not made for them ! My mission and my passion
      is to help these men and women find their own style, guiding them with
      ultra-personnalised service, empathy, and complicity.




      In the long run, investing in great fashion advice is ultimately more cost-effective than buying clothes you never wear ! ”

      **I never leave home without…**


      My ballet flats, which allow me to walk all around Paris and stay chic! When wearing heels, I carry the flats in my bag and switch when my feet beg for rest!


      **Three basics every woman must own**


      \- A loose white T-shirt, because it suits every body ! Wear it casual with jeans, or under a black leather jacket for a bit of rock-n-roll.


      \- A V-neck cashmere sweater : every Parisian girl’s must-have ! Choose a loose cut to reveal your shoulders, and style it with jeans, tailored pants, skirts… it goes with everything!


      \- A boyfriend blazer : invented by Monsieur Saint-Laurent, it is the signature of an incredibly timeless chic style ; where feminine meets masculine.


      **Do not…**


      Buy something thinking that you’ll wear it “ if ”: you loose weight, if you find the perfect occasion, if you finally take that trip…To make sure that the desired object is a good investment, you must be able to wear it right now, as well as being able to match it to 3 other pieces in your wardrobe. With this simple tip, you will avoid a lot a compulsive purchases!
